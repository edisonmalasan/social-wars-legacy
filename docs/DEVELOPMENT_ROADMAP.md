# Social Wars Modernization & Flash-Free Reconstruction Roadmap

> **Project:** Social Wars Legacy Reconstruction  
> **Primary Goal:** Reconstruct the existing Social Wars implementation into a modern, maintainable, Flash-free client/server game while preserving the behavior, content, saves, assets, and historical implementation contained in the current repository.
>
> **Core Strategy:** Preservation-first reconstruction.
>
> The existing repository will **not** be thrown away or treated merely as obsolete code.
>
> It will serve as:
>
> - Reference implementation
> - Behavioral specification
> - Protocol specification
> - Preservation dataset
> - Save-game corpus
> - Content database
> - Asset archive
> - Regression oracle
> - Migration source
> - Historical documentation
>
> The modern version will progressively replace Flash/SWF functionality with a Godot client while preserving the existing Python server until behavioral parity has been verified.
>
> Only after the new client is substantially functional should the backend be modernized into an authoritative production architecture backed by PostgreSQL.

# 1. Final Strategic Direction

The reconstruction should proceed through three major architectural stages.

## Stage A — Preserve the Current Implementation

```text
Flash Client
    │
    │ SWLoader.swf
    │ Basesec_*.swf
    │ FlashVars
    │ Legacy HTTP / form requests / AMF-era behavior
    ▼
Legacy Flask Server
    │
    ├── server.py
    ├── command.py
    ├── sessions.py
    ├── engine.py
    ├── get_player_info.py
    └── get_game_config.py
    │
    ▼
JSON Save Files
```

This implementation remains operational as the **behavioral oracle**.

Do not dismantle it during the first stages of development.

---

## Stage B — Flash-Free Compatibility Architecture

The first major target architecture should be:

```text
Godot Client
    │
    │ Modern JSON API
    ▼
Compatibility API v0
    │
    │ translates modern requests
    │ into legacy semantics
    ▼
Legacy Game Logic
    │
    ▼
JSON Save Files
```

At this stage:

- Flash Player is no longer required.
- The Godot client does not execute SWFs.
- The user can play through the modern client.
- Existing game behavior is preserved.
- Existing saves can still be loaded.
- Existing Python logic remains the behavioral reference.
- PostgreSQL is not yet required.
- Public account infrastructure is not yet required.

This should be achieved **before rewriting the backend**.

---

## Stage C — Production Architecture

The eventual production architecture becomes:

```text
Godot Client
    │
    │ HTTPS / JSON
    │ WebSocket only where justified
    ▼
Server API v1
    │
    ├── Authentication
    ├── Town Domain
    ├── Economy Domain
    ├── Buildings Domain
    ├── Units Domain
    ├── Inventory Domain
    ├── Research Domain
    ├── Quest Domain
    ├── Collections Domain
    ├── Missions Domain
    ├── Combat Domain
    └── Social Domain
    │
    ▼
PostgreSQL
    │
    ├── durable player state
    ├── transaction ledger
    ├── progression
    ├── missions
    ├── social state
    └── migration metadata
```

Optional infrastructure can later include:

```text
Redis
WebSockets
Admin tooling
Metrics
Job processing
CDN
```

These should only be introduced when they solve a demonstrated problem.

---

# 2. Non-Negotiable Engineering Principles

These rules should guide the entire reconstruction.

## 2.1 Preserve Before Replacing

Never remove or rewrite legacy behavior until its behavior has been:

1. observed,
2. documented,
3. recorded,
4. tested,
5. reproduced by the replacement.

---

## 2.2 Do Not Delete Original Data

Never destroy:

- SWFs
- JSON configuration
- existing saves
- images
- sounds
- XML files
- game configuration
- protocol examples
- legacy server code

Move them later into archival directories if necessary, but preserve their original versions.

---

## 2.3 Preserve Git History

When reorganizing files, use:

```bash
git mv
```

rather than deleting and recreating files whenever practical.

---

## 2.4 Do Not Redesign Gameplay During Parity Work

The reconstruction phase is not the time to rebalance the game.

Avoid changing:

- resource costs,
- XP rewards,
- building times,
- combat formulas,
- quest requirements,
- unit stats,
- progression pacing,
- unlock requirements.

First reproduce the existing game.

Improvements can happen later.

---

## 2.5 Never Rewrite Client and Server Semantics Simultaneously

A dangerous migration would be:

```text
Flash → Godot
Flask → completely different server
JSON saves → PostgreSQL
Legacy protocol → new protocol
```

all at once.

That would make behavioral regressions extremely difficult to diagnose.

Instead:

```text
Preserve server
    ↓
Replace client
    ↓
Verify parity
    ↓
Replace server internals
    ↓
Verify parity again
```

---

## 2.6 Every Migrated Feature Needs a Legacy Fixture

Before replacing a feature, capture examples of:

```text
request
before state
response
after state
```

These become golden-master tests.

---

## 2.7 Preserve Legacy IDs

Existing IDs used by:

- buildings,
- units,
- items,
- quests,
- research,
- collections,
- missions,
- effects,
- animations,
- assets

should remain stable.

The production database may use internal primary keys, but original IDs should be stored as:

```text
legacy_id
```

where appropriate.

---

## 2.8 Production Server Owns the Truth

The future server must be authoritative.

The client sends **intent**, not final state.

Bad:

```json
{
  "coins": 999999,
  "xp": 10000
}
```

Good:

```json
{
  "building_id": "barracks_01",
  "x": 24,
  "y": 17
}
```

The server determines:

```text
Is the building unlocked?
Does the player have enough resources?
Is placement valid?
What does it cost?
How much XP is awarded?
When does construction finish?
What state should be written?
```

---

## 2.9 SWF Files Become Archival References

The final runtime must not rely on:

- Adobe Flash Player
- Ruffle
- ActionScript runtime
- SWLoader.swf
- Basesec SWFs
- sprite SWFs
- FX SWFs
- AMF
- FlashVars

SWFs may remain inside:

```text
legacy/
```

for preservation and reference.

They must not be required by the final game runtime.

---

# 3. Legacy Component Classification

The existing repository should be classified before significant restructuring.

| Component | Strategy | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `server.py` | KEEP + FREEZE | Legacy HTTP behavior oracle |
| `sessions.py` | KEEP → REWRITE LATER | Save/session semantics |
| `command.py` | KEEP + DECOMPOSE | Primary game behavior specification |
| `engine.py` | AUDIT + EXTRACT | Reusable calculations where possible |
| `get_game_config.py` | KEEP + NORMALIZE | Content/configuration source |
| `get_player_info.py` | KEEP → REPLACE | Player bootstrap behavior |
| AMF/form protocol | LEGACY ONLY | Compatibility/reference |
| `templates/play.html` | ARCHIVE | Flash bootstrap |
| `SWLoader.swf` | ARCHIVE | Flash loader |
| `Basesec_*.swf` | ARCHIVE | Legacy client implementation |
| PNG/JPG assets | KEEP | Direct reusable content where legally permitted |
| MP3/audio assets | KEEP/CONVERT | Runtime audio source |
| SWF sprites | CONVERT | Godot-compatible assets |
| SWF effects | CONVERT/RECREATE | Godot effects |
| JSON game config | KEEP + VALIDATE | Canonical content source |
| JSON saves | KEEP + MIGRATE | Golden fixtures and migration source |

---

# 4. Target Repository Structure

Do not immediately restructure everything.

During early development the repository can gradually move toward:

```text
social-wars-legacy/
├── apps/
│   ├── client-godot/
│   ├── compat-v0/
│   └── server-v1/
│
├── packages/
│   └── game-content/
│       ├── raw/
│       ├── normalized/
│       ├── schemas/
│       └── generated/
│
├── tools/
│   ├── protocol-recorder/
│   ├── protocol-replay/
│   ├── state-diff/
│   ├── asset-pipeline/
│   ├── content-builder/
│   └── save-migrator/
│
├── tests/
│   ├── fixtures/
│   ├── golden/
│   ├── saves/
│   ├── integration/
│   ├── migration/
│   └── visual/
│
├── docs/
│   ├── architecture/
│   ├── legacy-protocol/
│   ├── game-systems/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── migrations/
│   └── adr/
│
├── legacy/
│   ├── server/
│   ├── flash/
│   ├── assets/
│   └── saves/
│
└── README.md
```

Initially keep the existing structure intact.

Move legacy components only after the migration tooling and modern directories are established.

---

# 5. Phase 0 — Freeze and Preserve the Legacy Baseline

## Objective

Create a reproducible snapshot of the working legacy implementation before modifying architecture.

---

## Tasks

Create a Git tag:

```bash
git tag legacy-baseline
```

Document:

- Python version
- dependency versions
- operating system requirements
- startup procedure
- default ports
- required environment configuration
- directory expectations
- Flash client startup flow
- default player/save
- known bugs
- known broken features
- known incomplete features
- asset versions
- EXT_VERSION or equivalent content version
- expected URLs
- expected game bootstrap process

---

## Create Asset Hash Manifest

Generate SHA-256 hashes for:

```text
*.swf
*.json
*.xml
*.png
*.jpg
*.jpeg
*.mp3
*.wav
*.gif
```

Example:

```json
{
  "path": "assets/flash/SWLoader.swf",
  "sha256": "...",
  "size": 123456
}
```

This provides a permanent record of the original artifact set.

---

## Create Canonical Save Fixtures

Preserve multiple representative saves.

Recommended fixtures:

```text
tests/saves/fresh-player.json
tests/saves/early-game.json
tests/saves/mid-game.json
tests/saves/late-game.json
tests/saves/stress-town.json
```

Try to include:

### Fresh Player

- tutorial state
- starter buildings
- starter units
- starter currencies

### Early Game

- construction
- basic unit queues
- first quests

### Mid Game

- research
- collections
- larger inventory
- multiple zones

### Late Game

- advanced unlocks
- missions
- high-level buildings
- advanced units

### Stress Town

- dense town
- many buildings
- many units
- many queued operations
- large inventory

---

## Deliverables

```text
docs/legacy-baseline.md
docs/known-legacy-bugs.md
tests/saves/
tools/hash-manifest/
legacy-manifest.json
```

---

## Exit Criteria

The legacy game can be reproduced from a clean environment using documented instructions.

---

# 6. Phase 1 — Build the Legacy Protocol Recorder

This is one of the most important phases of the entire project.

## Objective

Turn the legacy implementation into an observable behavioral specification.

---

## Capture

For every request:

```text
timestamp
endpoint
HTTP method
request body
parsed command
player ID
session ID where appropriate
state before
response
state after
HTTP status
execution duration
```

---

## Important Rule

Instrumentation must not change behavior.

The recorder should observe the legacy system, not rewrite it.

---

## Golden Fixture Structure

Example:

```text
tests/golden/building-buy/
├── request.json
├── before.json
├── response.json
└── after.json
```

Other fixture examples:

```text
tests/golden/building-move/
tests/golden/unit-order/
tests/golden/collect-income/
tests/golden/start-research/
tests/golden/claim-quest/
tests/golden/mission-attack/
```

---

# 7. Build an Exhaustive Legacy Command Catalog

`command.py` is effectively a major portion of the existing game specification.

Create:

```text
docs/legacy-protocol/commands.md
```

or preferably a machine-readable catalog plus generated documentation.

Each command should include:

```text
Command name
Domain
Endpoint
Required parameters
Optional parameters
State read
State modified
Resources consumed
Rewards produced
Timers created
Dependencies
Client-trusted fields
Security concerns
Observed fixtures
Replacement API
Migration status
```

---

## Suggested Status Values

```text
UNOBSERVED
CAPTURED
DOCUMENTED
V0_SUPPORTED
V1_SUPPORTED
PARITY_VERIFIED
RETIRED
OUT_OF_SCOPE
```

---

## Example

```yaml
command: buy
domain: buildings
status: CAPTURED

inputs:
  - building_id
  - x
  - y

reads:
  - player.resources
  - player.level
  - town.objects
  - town.zones

writes:
  - player.resources
  - town.objects
  - player.xp

security:
  legacy_client_trust: high

replacement:
  endpoint: POST /v1/towns/me/buildings
```

---

# 8. Phase 2 — Define the Canonical Domain Model

Before building extensive modern code, define the conceptual game model.

Core domain objects should include:

```text
Player
Town
Map
Zone
TownObject
Building
Decoration
Unit
UnitInstance
Resource
InventoryItem
InventoryStack
ProductionQueue
Research
Quest
QuestObjective
Collection
Mission
Battle
Friend
Visit
Reward
Event
ContentDefinition
```

---

# 9. Separate Definitions From Player State

This distinction is extremely important.

## Definition Data

Shared static game content:

```text
Barracks
cost = 500 coins
build_time = 60
footprint = 3x3
required_level = 5
```

---

## Player Instance State

Player-owned object:

```text
instance_id = 8937
definition_id = barracks
x = 24
y = 17
level = 2
construction_ready_at = ...
```

Never merge these concepts.

Use patterns similar to:

```text
BuildingDefinition
BuildingInstance

UnitDefinition
UnitInstance

QuestDefinition
QuestProgress
```

---

# 10. Phase 3 — Build Canonical Game Content

Create a normalized content package.

```text
packages/game-content/
├── raw/
├── normalized/
│   ├── buildings.json
│   ├── units.json
│   ├── items.json
│   ├── quests.json
│   ├── research.json
│   ├── collections.json
│   └── missions.json
├── schemas/
│   ├── building.schema.json
│   ├── unit.schema.json
│   ├── quest.schema.json
│   └── ...
├── generated/
└── manifest.json
```

---

## Requirements

Every content definition should preserve:

```text
legacy_id
source
content version
asset references
dependencies
```

---

## Validate Content

The content builder should detect:

```text
duplicate IDs
unknown references
missing assets
invalid costs
invalid requirements
broken quest dependencies
broken research dependencies
missing unit references
missing building references
missing reward references
```

---

# 11. Phase 4 — Build the SWF Asset Migration Pipeline

Do not manually convert assets without tracking them.

Create a central asset registry.

---

## Asset Registry Fields

Each asset should track:

```text
source SWF
source hash
symbol/class name
legacy asset ID
category
dimensions
registration point
pivot
frame count
frame rate
frame labels
nested MovieClips
masks
blend modes
color transforms
filters
scale grids
ActionScript dependencies
output path
Godot resource
conversion status
notes
```

---

## Example

```yaml
legacy_id: building_barracks_01

source:
  file: assets/sprites/buildings.swf
  symbol: Barracks01

type: building

dimensions:
  width: 270
  height: 220

registration:
  x: 135
  y: 198

animation:
  frames: 12
  fps: 24

conversion:
  status: converted
  output: assets/runtime/buildings/barracks_01/
```

---

# 12. Preserve Important Flash Rendering Semantics

Asset conversion can easily become visually incorrect if these are ignored:

- registration points
- pivots
- nested MovieClips
- masks
- alpha
- color transforms
- blend modes
- shadows
- glow filters
- scale grids
- tween timing
- frame labels
- transform inheritance
- morph animations
- ActionScript-controlled states

These should be documented per asset where relevant.

---

# 13. Asset Conversion Mapping

Recommended mappings:

| Legacy Asset | Modern Replacement |
|---|---|
| Static bitmap | PNG / WebP |
| Vector icon | SVG or rasterized texture |
| Simple MovieClip | SpriteFrames |
| Complex animation | AnimationPlayer |
| Unit animation | AnimatedSprite2D / AnimationPlayer |
| UI panel | TextureRect / NinePatchRect |
| Flash scale-grid UI | NinePatchRect |
| MovieClip hierarchy | Godot scene |
| Flash particle effect | GPUParticles2D |
| Complex FX | Godot shader / scene animation |
| MP3 | OGG/WAV |
| Flash button | Godot Control/Button scene |

---

## Asset Directory Separation

Never overwrite original assets.

Use:

```text
assets/raw/
assets/converted/
assets/runtime/
```

or equivalent.

---

# 14. Asset Conversion Priorities

Do not attempt to convert every asset before the game runs.

Suggested order:

```text
1. Terrain
2. One building
3. One unit
4. Essential HUD
5. Selection indicators
6. Placement grid
7. Common buildings
8. Common units
9. Common UI
10. Combat effects
11. Missions
12. Rare content
13. Special events
```

---

# 15. Phase 5 — Initialize the Godot Client

Use a pinned stable Godot 4.x version.

Document it in:

```text
apps/client-godot/README.md
```

---

## Recommended Language

Use **GDScript initially** unless there is a strong reason to use C#.

Reasons:

- quickest Godot iteration
- excellent engine integration
- simpler deployment
- appropriate for UI-heavy and scene-heavy work
- easier contributor setup

C# can still be introduced later for specific systems if justified.

---

# 16. Suggested Godot Structure

```text
apps/client-godot/
├── project.godot
│
├── scenes/
│   ├── boot/
│   ├── town/
│   ├── buildings/
│   ├── units/
│   ├── missions/
│   └── ui/
│
├── scripts/
│   ├── core/
│   ├── networking/
│   ├── domain/
│   └── utils/
│
├── assets/
│
└── tests/
```

---

# 17. Godot Autoloads

Keep global singletons limited.

Potential autoloads:

```text
App
GameApi
Session
ContentRegistry
GameClock
Settings
AudioManager
```

Avoid creating a giant global `GameManager` containing every system.

---

# 18. Critical GameApi Abstraction

The Godot UI should never directly know about:

```text
command.php
AMF
FlashVars
form encoding
legacy URLs
legacy command names
```

Create an abstraction such as:

```gdscript
class_name GameApi
```

with operations similar to:

```text
get_bootstrap()
get_player()
get_town()

buy_building()
move_building()
sell_building()
upgrade_building()
collect_building()

order_unit()
cancel_unit_order()
collect_unit()

start_research()
cancel_research()
claim_research()

start_quest()
claim_quest()

start_mission()
attack_target()
```

---

## Initial Implementation

```text
LegacyV0Api
```

Later:

```text
ServerV1Api
```

The rest of Godot should not care which implementation is active.

---

# 19. Phase 5.5 — Compatibility API v0

Create a modern-facing API in front of the legacy server.

For example:

```http
POST /v0/buildings/buy
```

Request:

```json
{
  "building_id": "barracks",
  "x": 24,
  "y": 17
}
```

Internally:

```text
Compatibility API
    ↓
translate request
    ↓
legacy command semantics
    ↓
legacy response
    ↓
normalize
    ↓
Godot response
```

---

## Benefits

Godot never needs to implement:

```text
legacy form encoding
command.php specifics
Flash-oriented request structures
AMF
FlashVars
```

When Server v1 arrives, only the API implementation changes.

---

# 20. Phase 6 — First Flash-Free Vertical Slice

This is the first major development target.

Do not wait for full game parity.

---

## Required Flow

```text
Launch Godot
    ↓
Connect to compatibility server
    ↓
Load game configuration
    ↓
Load player
    ↓
Load town
    ↓
Render terrain
    ↓
Render buildings
    ↓
Render at least one unit
    ↓
Display HUD resources
    ↓
Allow camera movement
    ↓
Allow object selection
```

---

## Vertical Slice Requirements

### Bootstrap

Implement:

```text
configuration loading
player loading
town loading
content registry
session initialization
```

---

### Town Renderer

Implement:

```text
isometric grid
grid-to-screen conversion
screen-to-grid conversion
camera movement
zoom
town bounds
depth sorting
object footprint handling
selection
HUD
```

---

### First Building

Convert one real building.

Support:

```text
load
render
select
move
```

---

### First Unit

Convert one real unit.

Support:

```text
load
render
idle animation
select
```

---

# 21. First Major Gate

The following must work on a machine with:

```text
NO Adobe Flash
NO Ruffle
NO Flash plugin
NO ActionScript runtime
```

Godot should:

```text
launch
load an existing save
load game content
render town terrain
render buildings
render units
render HUD
pan camera
zoom camera
select objects
```

Once this works, the reconstruction has passed its first critical milestone.

---

# 22. Phase 7 — Building System Parity

Implement building functionality in dependency order.

```text
1. Load existing town objects
2. Select objects
3. Placement preview
4. Grid validation
5. Buy building
6. Construction
7. Move
8. Flip / rotate where applicable
9. Store
10. Restore
11. Upgrade
12. Sell
13. Remove
14. Unlock zones
15. Clear obstacles
16. Collect resources
```

---

# 23. Placement System Requirements

The town grid must properly understand:

```text
multi-tile footprints
town bounds
locked zones
occupied tiles
collision rules
placement previews
object pivots
base tile positions
selection hitboxes
orientation
depth sorting
```

Do not use texture dimensions as gameplay footprint dimensions.

A large image may occupy only a small number of logical tiles.

---

# 24. Isometric Coordinate Tests

Create automated tests for:

```text
grid → screen
screen → grid
negative coordinates
boundary coordinates
large coordinates
multi-tile footprints
camera transformations
zoom transformations
```

This logic will affect almost every town interaction.

---

# 25. Phase 8 — Economy and Timer Systems

Reconstruct:

```text
coins
resources
premium currency
XP
building income
production
construction
cooldowns
collections
rewards
```

---

# 26. Server-Based Timer Model

Never trust the client clock.

Server responses should include:

```json
{
  "server_time": 1789257600,
  "ready_at": 1789257900
}
```

The client computes a server offset.

---

## Persist Timers As State

Prefer:

```text
started_at
duration
ready_at
```

over creating one background worker for every timer.

---

# 27. Economy Invariants

Create tests such as:

```text
resource balances never become invalid
premium currency cannot be duplicated
purchases cannot execute without sufficient resources
rewards cannot be claimed twice
collect cannot execute before timer completion
client clocks cannot skip timers
```

---

# 28. Economy Ledger

For the production server, important currency mutations should create ledger entries.

Example fields:

```text
player_id
resource
amount
reason
related_entity
balance_before
balance_after
timestamp
request_id
```

This is especially important for:

```text
premium currency
quest rewards
mission rewards
admin grants
migration adjustments
purchases
```

---

# 29. Phase 9 — Inventory and Crafting

Implement:

```text
load inventory
add item
remove item
buy item
consume item
store item
activate item
deactivate item
craft
recycle
expiry
gift-related inventory behavior
```

---

## Inventory Invariants

```text
quantity >= 0
cannot consume missing item
cannot claim reward twice
crafting inputs removed atomically
crafting output added atomically
unknown definitions rejected or preserved during migration
```

---

# 30. Phase 10 — Unit Systems

Separate:

```text
UnitDefinition
UnitInstance
```

---

## Unit Definition

Contains shared data such as:

```text
unit type
health
damage
movement speed
animation references
production time
cost
unlock requirements
```

---

## Unit Instance

Contains:

```text
instance ID
definition ID
current health
position
state
energy
temporary effects
```

---

## Reconstruct

```text
unit loading
production
queues
queue cancellation
queue collection
town movement
idle animation
walking animation
attack animation
damage
death
energy
revive
healing
special behaviors
```

---

# 31. Phase 11 — Player Progression

Implement:

```text
XP
levels
level rewards
unlocks
tutorial state
objectives
challenges
progress flags
```

---

## Server Owns Unlock Logic

Do not simply trust:

```text
client says player reached level X
```

Server calculates progression.

---

# 32. Phase 12 — Quest System

Model quests explicitly.

Example:

```text
QuestDefinition
├── prerequisites
├── objectives
└── rewards

QuestProgress
├── state
├── objective progress
├── started_at
└── completed_at
```

---

## Objective Types

Potential objective types:

```text
build
upgrade
collect
produce
own
spend
earn
mission
combat
research
craft
visit
help
level
```

Do not hardcode every quest as custom logic if generic objective types can represent it.

---

# 33. Phase 13 — Research System

Implement:

```text
research definitions
requirements
prerequisites
research costs
research timers
start research
cancel research
complete research
unlock effects
```

Completed research must remain permanently recorded.

---

# 34. Phase 14 — Collection System

Model separately:

```text
CollectionDefinition
CollectionProgress
CollectionReward
```

Support:

```text
item acquisition
collection progress
collection completion
reward claim
```

Reward claiming must be transactional and one-time.

---

# 35. Phase 15 — Missions and Combat

Start by reproducing compatibility behavior.

Later transition combat to server authority.

---

## Bad Combat API

```json
{
  "target_hp": 0,
  "reward": 500
}
```

This trusts the client.

---

## Correct Combat Intent

```json
{
  "attacker_id": "unit-123",
  "target_id": "enemy-456",
  "action": "attack"
}
```

Server determines:

```text
attacker exists
target exists
mission active
attacker alive
target alive
range valid
cooldown valid
energy valid
damage amount
critical result
death result
reward result
```

---

# 36. Prefer Deterministic Action-Based Combat

Social Wars does not necessarily require MMO-style server simulation.

A simpler model:

```text
initial state
+
player action
+
game rules
=
result
+
state mutation
+
combat event
```

The Godot client animates the server result.

This makes:

```text
testing
replay
anti-cheat
debugging
migration
```

significantly easier.

---

# 37. Combat Event Log

Eventually record events such as:

```text
mission_id
action_number
attacker
target
action_type
damage
critical
status_effect
resulting_hp
timestamp
```

Useful for:

```text
debugging
replay
analytics
anti-cheat
support
```

---

# 38. Phase 16 — Social Systems

Reconstruct:

```text
friends
friend scores
visits
visit rewards
help mechanics
neighbor mechanics
leaderboards
social rewards
```

The production server must own social relationship state.

---

# 39. Phase 17 — Special and Rare Legacy Systems

`command.py` contains behavior outside the main town loop.

Examples that should be explicitly audited include:

```text
SOC/event systems
temporary events
rider mechanics
penguin mechanics
dive mechanics
superspy mechanics
rage mechanics
hero mechanics
special powers
temporary items
special crafting
special buildings
event progression
event-specific currencies
```

These should not block the first playable modern client.

However, each one must eventually receive one of:

```text
IMPLEMENTED
PARITY_VERIFIED
OUT_OF_SCOPE
RETIRED
```

Do not silently forget them.

---

# 40. Phase 18 — Begin Server API v1

Only begin this stage when the Godot client is substantially functional through Compatibility API v0.

---

# 41. Recommended Production Backend Stack

Because the existing game logic is Python, a practical target is:

```text
Python
FastAPI
Pydantic
SQLAlchemy
Alembic
PostgreSQL
Pytest
```

Optional later:

```text
Redis
background jobs
WebSockets
```

---

## Why Not Immediately Rewrite to NestJS?

A NestJS rewrite would simultaneously introduce:

```text
new language
new framework
new architecture
new persistence model
new game client
```

without materially helping the reconstruction.

Keeping Python initially allows legacy algorithms and knowledge to be migrated incrementally.

NestJS remains viable if there is a strong organizational reason to standardize on TypeScript.

---

# 42. Server v1 Domain Structure

Example:

```text
apps/server-v1/
├── api/
│   └── v1/
│
├── domain/
│   ├── players/
│   ├── towns/
│   ├── economy/
│   ├── buildings/
│   ├── units/
│   ├── inventory/
│   ├── research/
│   ├── quests/
│   ├── collections/
│   ├── missions/
│   ├── combat/
│   └── social/
│
├── services/
├── repositories/
├── infrastructure/
├── migrations/
└── tests/
```

---

# 43. Do Not Recreate `command.py`

The giant legacy command dispatcher should not become:

```text
/v1/command
```

forever.

Replace it with domain-oriented APIs.

Examples:

```http
GET /v1/bootstrap

GET /v1/towns/me

POST /v1/towns/me/buildings

POST /v1/towns/me/buildings/{id}/move

POST /v1/towns/me/buildings/{id}/upgrade

POST /v1/towns/me/buildings/{id}/collect

POST /v1/units/queues

DELETE /v1/units/queues/{id}

POST /v1/research/{id}/start

POST /v1/quests/{id}/claim

POST /v1/missions/{id}/start

POST /v1/missions/{id}/actions
```

---

# 44. Authoritative Server Rule

The legacy implementation may trust client-provided state changes.

The production implementation must not.

For example:

```text
Client:
"Build Barracks at tile 24,17"
```

Server:

```text
1. Load player state.
2. Load building definition.
3. Validate player level.
4. Validate unlock.
5. Validate prerequisites.
6. Validate town zone.
7. Validate placement.
8. Validate resource balance.
9. Calculate price.
10. Deduct resources.
11. Create building instance.
12. Calculate XP.
13. Start construction timer.
14. Increment state revision.
15. Commit transaction.
16. Return authoritative result.
```

---

# 45. PostgreSQL Data Model

Potential tables:

```text
accounts
players
towns
town_zones
town_objects
buildings
unit_instances
unit_queues
inventory_items
inventory_stacks
player_resources
economy_ledger
research_progress
quest_progress
objective_progress
collection_progress
missions
mission_sessions
combat_events
friendships
friend_visits
player_unlocks
content_versions
migration_runs
audit_events
```

Exact schema should follow discovered legacy behavior rather than being finalized prematurely.

---

# 46. Use JSONB Carefully

JSONB is useful for:

```text
unknown legacy fields
migration metadata
rare event payloads
temporary compatibility state
```

Do not simply move the entire old village JSON into one giant PostgreSQL JSONB column and call the migration complete.

Core production state should become structured.

---

# 47. Concurrency Protection

Use player or town revision numbers.

Example:

```json
{
  "expected_revision": 73
}
```

Server compares this against current revision.

If stale:

```http
409 Conflict
```

Client then resynchronizes.

---

# 48. Idempotency

Commands such as:

```text
purchase
collect
claim
craft
mission reward
premium transaction
```

must tolerate network retries.

Use:

```http
Idempotency-Key: UUID
```

If the same request is retried, the server should return the previous result instead of executing it twice.

---

# 49. Database Transactions

Operations that modify multiple pieces of state must be atomic.

Example building purchase:

```text
deduct coins
create building
award XP
update quest objective
write economy ledger
increase revision
```

All should succeed or fail together.

---

# 50. Phase 19 — Legacy Save Migration

Build a dedicated save migration CLI.

Example:

```bash
socialwars-migrate inspect old-save.json

socialwars-migrate validate old-save.json

socialwars-migrate import old-save.json

socialwars-migrate verify old-save.json
```

---

## Support Dry Runs

```bash
socialwars-migrate import old-save.json --dry-run
```

Dry-run output should show:

```text
player detected
resources detected
objects detected
units detected
inventory detected
quests detected
research detected
collections detected
unknown fields detected
validation errors
planned database mutations
```

---

# 51. Save Validation

Check:

```text
known object IDs
known unit IDs
known item IDs
known research IDs
known quests
known collections
resource validity
town positions
map bounds
object overlap
duplicate object IDs
duplicate unit IDs
queue state
timestamps
timer validity
unknown fields
```

---

# 52. Never Silently Drop Unknown Save Data

Unknown legacy fields should be retained somewhere like:

```text
legacy_extra
```

during migration.

This allows future investigation instead of destructive loss.

---

# 53. Migration Must Be Idempotent

Track:

```text
source save hash
migration version
player
import timestamp
migration status
```

Re-importing the same file should not duplicate objects or rewards.

---

# 54. Phase 20 — Authentication and Security

For local preservation mode, complex authentication may not be required.

For public hosting, implement proper account security.

---

## Required Production Measures

```text
no hardcoded secrets
environment-based secrets
HTTPS
secure password hashing where applicable
session expiry
refresh token rotation
request validation
rate limiting
payload limits
authorization checks
audit logging
server-side economy validation
server-side combat validation
server-side ownership validation
```

---

# 55. Local and Online Modes

The architecture could eventually support both.

## Preservation / Offline Mode

```text
Godot
    ↓
Local Compatibility Server
    ↓
Local Save
```

---

## Online Mode

```text
Godot
    ↓
Server API v1
    ↓
PostgreSQL
```

Because both use `GameApi`, the game client can avoid duplicating most gameplay/UI code.

---

# 56. Testing Strategy

Testing is essential because the goal is reconstruction rather than merely writing a similar game.

---

# 57. Golden-Master Tests

For each legacy operation compare:

```text
legacy before
legacy request
legacy response
legacy after
```

against the modern implementation.

Verify:

```text
resource mutations
object mutations
timers
XP
rewards
progression
queues
inventory
mission state
```

---

# 58. Replay Tests

Create gameplay sequences.

Example:

```text
load fresh player
buy building
move building
collect resource
order unit
collect unit
start research
claim research
complete quest
start mission
attack enemy
claim mission reward
```

Run the same sequence against:

```text
Legacy Server
Compatibility API v0
Server API v1
```

Compare state transitions.

---

# 59. Game Invariant Tests

Important invariants:

```text
resources remain valid
premium currency cannot duplicate
object IDs remain unique
unit IDs remain unique
buildings cannot overlap illegally
buildings cannot enter locked zones
queues respect capacity
rewards cannot be claimed twice
completed research remains completed
dead units cannot attack
unowned units cannot be controlled
client clock cannot complete timers early
```

---

# 60. Network Failure Tests

Test:

```text
request timeout
duplicate request
lost response
reconnect
server restart
database rollback
stale revision
request retry
out-of-order response
expired session
content version mismatch
client version mismatch
```

---

# 61. Visual Regression Tests

Maintain reference scenes for:

```text
town layout
building placement
unit animation
combat
HUD
missions
dialogs
```

Compare:

```text
position
scale
pivot
frame
orientation
depth
spacing
```

---

# 62. Performance Testing

Create stress scenarios for:

```text
large towns
hundreds of town objects
many animated units
many simultaneous FX
rapid pan/zoom
large inventory
large content catalog
network bootstrap
save imports
```

Measure before optimizing.

---

## Likely Optimization Areas

```text
off-screen animation throttling
visibility culling
sprite atlases
object pooling
resource caching
lazy UI loading
asset streaming
batching
```

---

# 63. CI Pipeline

The project should eventually run automated CI for:

```text
legacy regression tests
Python linting
Python type checking
Server v1 unit tests
PostgreSQL integration tests
content schema validation
save migration tests
asset manifest validation
Godot headless project import
Godot tests
Godot build
runtime dependency inspection
```

---

# 64. Flash-Free CI Gate

Production packaging should fail if the runtime artifact contains:

```text
*.swf
Flash Player runtime
Ruffle runtime
ActionScript runtime
legacy Flash loader
```

The final client should not depend on them.

---

# 65. Release Artifact Separation

Produce separate artifacts:

```text
legacy-reference
client
server
content
save-migrator
```

The production client must not accidentally package:

```text
legacy/
```

---

# 66. Observability

Production Server v1 should implement structured logging.

Include:

```text
request ID
player ID
action ID
domain
duration
result
revision
```

without exposing sensitive data.

---

## Useful Metrics

```text
request rates
error rates
database latency
slow actions
migration failures
economy anomalies
combat failures
queue failures
content mismatches
```

---

# 67. Admin and Support Tools

Eventually provide tools for:

```text
player lookup
town inspection
resource inspection
inventory inspection
action history
migration history
economy ledger
grant resource with reason
revoke resource with reason
restore snapshot
disable account
inspect content version
```

A CLI is sufficient initially.

A web dashboard can come later.

---

# 68. Content Versioning

Track:

```text
client version
protocol version
content version
server version
```

Bootstrap may return:

```json
{
  "server_version": "1.3.0",
  "protocol_version": 1,
  "content_version": "2026.09.01",
  "minimum_client_version": "0.8.0"
}
```

---

# 69. Server Owns Gameplay Rules

Critical values such as:

```text
building costs
unit costs
XP rewards
mission rewards
research requirements
timers
unlock rules
combat values
```

must be validated from server-controlled content.

Do not trust client copies of these values.

---

# 70. WebSocket Policy

Do not introduce WebSockets simply because the architecture is modern.

Use normal HTTPS requests for:

```text
town actions
building actions
inventory
quests
research
collections
mission commands
```

Use WebSockets later only when useful for:

```text
presence
real-time social events
live announcements
true live multiplayer
push notifications while connected
```

---

# 71. Legal and Provenance Workstream

This should not be ignored.

Create:

```text
PROVENANCE.md
```

and an asset registry containing:

```text
asset
source
original filename
modified status
creator where known
rights status
redistribution status
notes
```

---

## Important Distinction

The repository being GPL does **not automatically mean** every original Social Wars:

```text
art asset
music asset
sound asset
trademark
character
proprietary Flash client component
```

is automatically redistributable under GPL.

Before publicly redistributing reconstructed proprietary assets, obtain appropriate legal review.

---

# 72. Keep Implementations Distinguishable

Maintain separation between:

```text
legacy original material
decompiled reference
converted assets
clean modern implementation
```

This helps:

```text
maintenance
provenance
licensing review
debugging
preservation
```

---

# 73. Definition of Truly Flash-Free

The project is not genuinely Flash-free merely because Adobe Flash Player is gone.

For this project, Flash retirement means:

- Godot is the runtime client.
- No SWF executes during gameplay.
- No ActionScript executes.
- No Flash Player is required.
- No Ruffle runtime is required.
- `SWLoader.swf` is not packaged.
- `Basesec_*.swf` is not packaged.
- Sprite SWFs have been converted or recreated.
- FX SWFs have been converted or recreated.
- Flash UI assets have been converted or recreated.
- FlashVars are gone from the modern client.
- AMF is not required by the modern client.
- A clean machine can install and play the game without Flash-related software.
- CI verifies no Flash runtime dependency exists.

Archived SWFs may still exist in:

```text
legacy/
```

for preservation purposes.

---

camera works
selection works
```

This is the first major milestone to target.

---

# 77. Second Implementation Backlog

After the Flash-free town works, implement:

```text
building placement preview
grid validation
building purchase
building movement
building flip/orientation
building storage
building restoration
building selling
construction timer
building collection
town expansion
obstacle clearing
inventory loading
unit queue
unit production

```

---

# 78. Do Not Build These Early

Avoid spending early development time on:

Flask → NestJS rewrite
PostgreSQL migration before Godot works
Kubernetes
microservices
Redis everywhere
WebSockets everywhere
complete UI redesign
game rebalancing
mobile support
custom launcher/updater
public account infrastructure
new multiplayer functionality
```

The first problem to solve is:

> Can the existing Social Wars game be faithfully reconstructed and played through a modern client with no Flash dependency?

Everything else follows from that.

---

# 79. Major Technical Risks

## Risk 1 — Important Logic Exists Only in Compiled SWFs

Mitigation:

```text
protocol recording
decompilation/reference analysis
behavioral observation
golden-master testing
state-diff testing
```

---

## Risk 2 — SWF Animations Are More Complex Than Expected

Mitigation:

```text
asset registry
conversion priority
automated extraction where practical
manual recreation for complex assets
visual regression testing
```

---

## Risk 3 — Hidden/Obscure Commands Are Missed

Mitigation:

```text
generated command catalog
coverage tracking
protocol recording
fixture requirements
migration status tracking
```

---

## Risk 4 — Legacy Saves Are Inconsistent

Mitigation:

```text
multiple fixtures
strict validator
raw source preservation
legacy_extra
migration reports
```

---

## Risk 5 — Server Rewrite Changes Behavior

Mitigation:

```text
replay tests
golden tests
legacy-vs-v1 comparison
state-diff tooling
```

---

## Risk 6 — Client Cheating

Mitigation:

```text
authoritative server
economy ledger
server-side rules
ownership validation
revision checking
idempotency
```

---

## Risk 7 — Duplicate Rewards Due to Network Retries

Mitigation:

```text
database transactions
idempotency keys
unique constraints
revision validation
reward claim records
```

---

## Risk 8 — Flash Dependency Survives in Rare UI/FX

Mitigation:

```text
asset dependency manifest
CI package scanning
conversion status tracking
final Flash-free gate
```

---

## Risk 9 — Original Asset Distribution Restrictions

Mitigation:

```text
provenance tracking
asset classification
distribution review
legal review before public release
```

---

## Checkpoint F — Flash Retirement

Successful when the game can:

```text
install
launch
load player
load town
play normal game loop
save progress
close
restart
resume
```

without:

```text
Flash Player
SWF execution
ActionScript
Ruffle
AMF
FlashVars
```

# 81. Recommended Architecture Decision Record

Create:

```text
docs/adr/ADR-001-preservation-first-reconstruction.md
```

Suggested content:

# ADR-001 — Preservation-First Social Wars Reconstruction

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The current project contains a working or partially working reconstruction of Social Wars using a Flask server and the original Flash client architecture.

Although Flash is obsolete as a runtime platform, the existing repository contains valuable behavioral logic, game configuration, save data, server behavior, protocol behavior, images, sounds, and compiled client assets.

Replacing everything simultaneously would make regression detection difficult and risk losing undocumented gameplay behavior.

## Decision

The current Flask/Flash implementation will be treated as the reference implementation and preservation dataset.

The legacy implementation will be frozen while a new Godot client is built.

The first modern client will communicate through a compatibility API that preserves legacy game semantics.

Once client-side feature parity has been established, the backend will progressively migrate toward an authoritative FastAPI server backed by PostgreSQL.

Existing JSON saves will be treated as migration inputs and regression fixtures.

SWFs may remain under an archival legacy directory but must not be required by the final runtime or included in production client packages.

## Consequences

Positive:

- undocumented behavior remains discoverable
- migrations can be verified
- client and server rewrites are decoupled
- existing saves remain usable
- Flash removal can happen incrementally
- regressions become testable

Negative:

- legacy infrastructure remains temporarily
- compatibility code must be maintained during migration
- repository contains old and new implementations simultaneously

These costs are acceptable because they substantially reduce reconstruction risk.

# 83. Immediate Priority Order

The immediate development sequence should be:

```text
FREEZE
    ↓
INSTRUMENT
    ↓
CATALOG
    ↓
REPLAY
    ↓
NORMALIZE CONTENT
    ↓
CREATE GODOT CLIENT
    ↓
BUILD COMPATIBILITY API
    ↓
RENDER ONE REAL TOWN
    ↓
BUILD MAIN GAMEPLAY LOOP
    ↓
REPLACE ALL RUNTIME SWFs
    ↓
BUILD AUTHORITATIVE SERVER
    ↓
MIGRATE TO POSTGRESQL
    ↓
HARDEN PRODUCTION
    ↓
RETIRE FLASH COMPLETELY
```

---

# 84. Most Important Near-Term Target

Do **not** make PostgreSQL or the backend rewrite the first visible result.

The first major target should be:

> Launch the Godot client on a computer with no Flash runtime, load one real existing Social Wars save, and faithfully render the town, buildings, units, resources, camera, and basic selection using preserved legacy data.

Once that works, the project has proven that the Flash client can actually be replaced.

---

# 85. Core Architectural Thesis

The most important idea guiding the project is:

> **The existing Social Wars repository is not obsolete code that should simply be replaced. It is the reference implementation, behavioral specification, protocol specification, preservation dataset, save corpus, content source, asset archive, and regression oracle for the reconstruction.**

The correct migration therefore is not:

```text
DELETE OLD GAME
    ↓
BUILD NEW GAME FROM MEMORY
```

It is:

```text
PRESERVE
    ↓
OBSERVE
    ↓
RECORD
    ↓
DOCUMENT
    ↓
REPRODUCE
    ↓
VERIFY
    ↓
REPLACE
    ↓
RETIRE
```

The existing Flask implementation should remain available until the Godot client and Server v1 can prove through recorded behavior, replay tests, golden fixtures, and state-diff tests that every required legacy system has a verified replacement.

That approach gives the project the best chance of achieving all four goals simultaneously:

1. **Preserve the original Social Wars behavior.**
2. **Remove the dependency on Flash/SWF completely.**
3. **Modernize the client/server architecture safely.**
4. **Create a maintainable foundation that can continue evolving after preservation parity is achieved.**

---

# 86. Recommended Development Workflow

For each major feature or migration unit:

```text
1. Explore legacy implementation.
2. Identify related commands/endpoints/assets/state.
3. Capture legacy fixtures.
4. Write/update OpenSpec change.
5. Define acceptance criteria.
6. Create feature branch.
7. Implement smallest complete vertical behavior.
8. Add automated tests.
9. Replay legacy fixtures.
10. Compare state.
11. Perform Godot/manual visual verification where applicable.
12. Update migration status.
13. Update documentation.
14. Review.
15. Merge.
16. Push.
```

---

# 87. Recommended Branch Strategy

Use branch-per-feature or branch-per-migration-unit.

Examples:

```text
feat/protocol-recorder
feat/state-diff
feat/content-normalization
feat/godot-bootstrap
feat/town-renderer
feat/building-placement
feat/unit-production
feat/quest-system
feat/server-v1-buildings
feat/save-migrator
```

Avoid creating enormous branches spanning several milestones.

---

# 88. OpenSpec Usage

Use OpenSpec for meaningful behavioral or architectural changes.

Each change should define:

```text
problem
scope
non-goals
existing behavior
target behavior
acceptance criteria
affected systems
migration concerns
testing requirements
```

For reconstruction work, include:

```text
Legacy reference:
- endpoint
- command
- source files
- fixtures

Parity requirements:
- expected state mutation
- expected response
- visual behavior where relevant
```

---

# 89. Definition of Done for a Migrated Feature

A migration feature is not complete merely because the new UI appears to work.

A migrated feature should normally satisfy:

```text
legacy behavior identified
legacy fixture captured
modern behavior implemented
automated test added
state mutation verified
error conditions tested
retry behavior considered
content IDs preserved
relevant assets migrated
documentation updated
migration status updated
no new Flash dependency introduced
```

For Server v1 features additionally require:

```text
server-authoritative validation
database transaction where needed
authorization
revision handling
idempotency where needed
economy ledger where needed
```

---

# 90. Final Project Definition of Done

The complete modernization is finished when:

```text
Godot is the only gameplay client.

Normal gameplay contains no SWF execution.

Normal gameplay contains no ActionScript execution.

Adobe Flash Player is unnecessary.

Ruffle is unnecessary.

The modern client does not know about command.php.

The modern client does not use FlashVars.

The modern client does not require AMF.

All gameplay-critical legacy commands are implemented,
retired, or explicitly declared out of scope.

All runtime-critical Flash assets have been converted
or recreated.

Existing supported legacy saves can be migrated.

Production player state lives in PostgreSQL.

Production game actions are server authoritative.

Important economy mutations are auditable.

Network retries cannot duplicate important rewards.

Client clock manipulation cannot bypass timers.

Authentication and authorization are production-safe.

Automated golden/replay tests verify important legacy parity.

Visual regression coverage exists for important scenes.

CI prevents accidental reintroduction of Flash dependencies.

Legacy files remain preserved separately for historical,
debugging, migration, and research purposes.

A clean machine can install the modern client,
connect to the server, load a player,
play the game, close it, reopen it,
and continue playing without installing
any Flash-related software.
```

# 92. The First Concrete Goal

The engineering team or coding agent should treat the following as the immediate mission:

> **Preserve and instrument the legacy implementation, then build the smallest Godot vertical slice capable of loading and displaying a real Social Wars town from an existing save without executing Flash or SWF content.**

Everything before that target should directly support it.

Everything that does not directly support it should generally wait.

The first sequence therefore is:

```text
M0 Preservation
    ↓
M1 Protocol Discovery
    ↓
M2 Recorder / Replay / State Diff
    ↓
M3 Content Normalization
    ↓
M4 Initial Asset Conversion
    ↓
M5 Godot Foundation
    ↓
M6 Flash-Free Town Vertical Slice
```

**M6 is the first major victory.**

Do not allow backend modernization, infrastructure work, or unrelated redesign to delay reaching it.
